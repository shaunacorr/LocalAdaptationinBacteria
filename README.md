The “Sequencing” Folder contains all scripts and input files for the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing diversity comparison of uncultured bacterial community samples, Seaweed-Derived Media samples and Marine Broth agar samples. The subfolder “Qiime2 Analysis” includes all commands used in Qiime alongside all input and output files.

All 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data generated during the current study are available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive,under BioProject PRJNA1223129 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/PRJNA1223129. The subfolder “R Studio Analysis” contains all input files and scripts for the alpha and beta diversity analysis conducted in R studio.

Files within the “Growth Assay” Folder contain all input files and scripts for conducting the reciprocal transplant experiment analysis in R studio.
